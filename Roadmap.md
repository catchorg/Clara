# Roadmap

## June 2019 Update

Previously this roadmap said, "I'm not quite ready to throw development fully open to the community effort". The intention had been to clarify the direction in the codebase in some key areas, as many of the PRs were taking it in different directions.

Unfortunuately the time intended for working on this has not appeared and this project has languished in neglect as a result. I should have acknowledged that sooner, but as of now I (@philsquared), am opening this up fully to the community (anyone who is still interested). That means, of course, that maintainers such as @horenmar, will be able to merge PRs as they see fit (as well as make any other changes). It also means that we'd be keen to hear from anyone that wants to take the lead in maintaining and evolving the library.

Personally, I still hope to contribute further to the project, but am no longer in a position I can commit to leading it.

Here are the items I had on the original roadmap, for reference. It is not a hard requirement to follow them:

- Add more documentation (includes [#49](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/49))
- Finish work on "required" parsers [#39](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/39), [#16](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/16) & [PR #28](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/pull/28)
- Finish work on removing exceptions completely (or making them "optional")
- (compiler conditional) Support for `std::optional` and maybe other optional types (e.g. boost) [#4](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/4) & [PR #45](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/pull/45) - this is mostly, if not entirely, implemented. Should be checked, and #4 closed if so.
- Arg\[0] support on Windows [#29](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/29)
- config files and environment variables
- "hidden" options [#29](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/29)
- Capture general text for help output [#48]((https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/48)
- subcommands [#31](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/issues/31) (I actually have a design mostly done for this) - but see also [PR #32](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara/pull/32)
